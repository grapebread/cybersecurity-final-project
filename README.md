12/14

- Josephine: Outlined presentation and started explaining encryption/decryption of Hill Cipher
- Shuprovo: Continued trying to work out how breaking the Hill cipher through known-plaintext attacks would be implemented (both in class and at home)

12/15

- Josephine: Worked on breaking the Hill cipher through frequency analysis
- Shuprovo: After working out known-plaintext attacks on paper, worked on implementing a manual version in code

12/16

- Josephine: Added dependencies/instructions; worked on explaining how the Hill Cipher works in the presentation
- Shuprovo: Continued to work out implementing breaking the cipher; had some issues with the matrix inverse modulo calculations but Mr. K gave us permission to use outside libraries

12/17
- Josephine: Worked on the presentation and coming up with examples/challenges.
- Shuprovo: Worked on the presentation and coming up with examples/challenges.

12/20
